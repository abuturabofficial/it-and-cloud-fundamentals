## Introduction to Business Continuity Principles

### Business continuity

- Risk management strategies minimize productivity issues
- Business continuity is having a plan to deal with disruptions
- Necessary for all businesses to remain operational under any circumstances

### Fault tolerance

- Ability of a system to continue operating when one or more components fail
- Anticipates disruptions and develops contingency plans
- Design systems without single points of failure

### Redundancy

- Minimizes the effects of system outages
- System redundancy strengthens existing fault tolerance levels
- Network redundancy seeks to prevent system outages
- Hardware redundancy serves as a solution to a server outage
- Additional capacity of a computer network above what is needed
- Safety net for the almost inevitable system or component failure
- Backup system at the ready
- 5 types of redundancy

#### Data redundancy

- First type of redundancy
- When the same piece of data exists in multiple places
- Might cause data inconsistency
- Multiple versions of the same file on a network
- Real-time syncing of data across all backups to ensure consistency

#### RAID redundancy

- Redundant array of independent disks (RAID)
- RAID 0: Allows a storage system to tolerate individual disk unit failures
- RAID 1: Exact copy (mirror) of a set of data on two or more disks
- RAID 5: Minimum of three hard disk drives (HDDs) and no maximum

#### Network redundancy

- Process of adding additional network devices and lines of communication
- Features include:
	- Multiple adapter cards and/or ports for individual hosts
	- Load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple servers
	- Multiple network paths
	- Routers can detect issues and reroute data

#### Site redundancy

- Ability to lose an entire site without losing signaling or application state data
- Guards against total loss of operations
- Employs the process of replication to synchronize data among multiple sites
- Ensures data access

#### Power redundancy

- Two independent power sources
- Eliminates potential downtime from the loss of the primary power source
- An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) adds another layer of protection against system downtime
- UPS is less expensive than a backup power generator

### Backup requirements

- Create a copy of data from which a business can restore when the primary copy is damaged or unavailable
- Have a specific and sequential strategy for backups
- Identify key backup concerns
- Select appropriate backup types

#### Backup methods

- Full – Copies all files
- Incremental – Copies only those files that have been altered since the last full backup
- Differential – Saves only the difference in the data since the last full backup
- Daily – keeps a backup of just those files that have been modified the same day the backup is done

#### Backup storage devices

- Used to make copies of data that is actively in use
- Provide redundancy of data residing on primary storage (usually a hard disk drive)
- Examples: USB drive, external hard drive, LAN, and tape

#### Backup considerations

- Costs:
	- Can include hardware, software, maintenance agreement, and training
- Location:
	- Backup to the cloud
	- Consider keeping a data copy in an additional location
- Requirements of each backup approach

### Disaster recovery plan

- Organization’s strategy for restoring functionality to its IT infrastructure
- Explains the actions to be taken before, during, and after a disaster
- Strategies for specific scenarios
- Method depends on needs and resources
