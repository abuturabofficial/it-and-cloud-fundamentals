# Introduction to Hardware Components and Peripherals

## Identifying Hardware Components and Peripherals

### What is a computer component?

- A physical part needed for computer functioning, also called “hardware”.
- Each component performs a specific task.
- Components can be internal or external.
- External components connect via ports and connectors.
- Without a given component, such as a CPU, a computer system cannot function as desired.

### Common internal components

A part inside a computing device:
	+ RAM
	+ Hard Drive
	+ CPU

### Peripherals

- Connect to the computer to transfer data.
- External devices easily removed and connected to a computer.
- Connections vary
- Examples: Mouse, Printer, and a Keyboard etc.

#### Categories of peripherals

- Input – send commands to the computer
- Output – receive commands from the computer
- Storage – save files indefinitely

#### Connectors for Components

- A connector is the unique end of a plug, jack, or the edge of a card that connects to a port.
- For example, all desktop computer expansion cards have an internal connector that allows them to connect to a slot on the motherboard.
- A Universal Serial Bus (USB) connector at the end of a cable is an example of an external connector.

#### Ports

- A connector plugs into an opening on a computer called a port.
- A port is the jack or receptacle for a peripheral device to plug into.
- Ports are standardized for each purpose.
- Common ports include USB ports and HDMI ports.

## Input and Pointing Devices

### Input Devices

	+ Keyboards
	+ Mouse
	+ Camera
	+ Joystick
	+ Trackball

### Pointing Devices

- The stylus (Pen)
	+ Input tool
	+ Moves the cursor and sends commands
	+ Generally used on tablets
	+ Uses capacitive technology
	+ Detects heat and pressure

## Hard Drives

Hard drives:
	+ are a repository for images, video, audio, and text.
	+ RAM
	+ ROM
	+ HDD/SSD/NVMe

### Hard drive performance

Measurement benchmarks
	+ Spin speed: how fast the platter spins.
	+ Access time: how fast the data is retrieved.
	+ Transfer/media rate: how fast the data is written to the drive.

### Connecting an internal hard drive

- Back up data
- transfer the enclosure
- Secure with screws
- prevent movement
- attach to motherboard via SATA/PATA cables
- plug into power supply
- finally, it can be configured in the disk management utility of windows

## Optical Drives and External Storage

### Optical drives

Reading and writing data
- Laser pressing or “burning”
- Burning pits on lands
- Reflective disk surface

Storage disks
- Single-sided
- Double-side

#### Types of optical drive

Several types
	+ CD-ROM
	+ CD-RW
	+ DVD-ROM
	+ DVD-RW
	+ Blu-ray


### Solid state drives

Solid state drive → (SSD)

- Integrated circuit assemblies store data
- Flash memory
- Permanent, secondary storage
- AKA “solid state drive” or “solid state disk”
- No moving parts
	- Unlike hard disk drives and floppy drives

### External hard drive

- File backup and transfer
- Capacity: 250 GB to 20 TB
	- Several file types
	- USB or eSATA connection
		- eSATA – signal, not power

### Expansion devices

- Additional file storage
- Usually, USB
- Frees hard drive space
- Automatically recognized
- Known as a “Thumb drive”
- Holds up to 2 TB of data

#### Flash Drives

- Combines a USB interface and Flash memory
- Highly portable
- Weighs less than an ounce
- Storage has risen as prices have dropped
- Available capacity up to 2 TB

#### Memory card

- Uses Flash memory to store data
- Found in portable devices such as portable media players and smartphones
- Contained inside a device
	- Unlike USB drives
- Available in both Secure Digital (SD) and Micro Secure Digital (MSD) formats

## Display Devices

Defining display devices:
- Hardware component for the output of information in visual form
- Tactile monitors present information in a fingertip-readable format
- Often seen as television sets and computer monitors

### Cathode ray tube (CRT) monitors

- Create an image by directing electrons beams over phosphor dots
- Used in monitors throughout the mid to late 1990s
- By 1990, they boasted 800 × 600 pixel resolution

### Flat-screen monitors

- Also known as liquid crystal display (LCD)/ Think film transistor (TFT)
- Digital signal drives color value of each picture element (Pixel)
- Replaced CRT monitors

### Touchscreens

- Use a touch panel on an electronic display
- Capacitive technology measures heat and pressure
- Often found on smartphones, laptops, and tablets

### Projectors

- Take images from a computer and display them
- the surface projected onto is large, flat, and lightly colored
- Projected images can be still or animated

## Printers and Scanners

### Output devices

“Hardware that shows data in readable form.”

That data can take many forms:

- Scanner and speech synthesizer
- Unnecessary (though highly useful) for computer function

### Printers

+ Laser/LED
+ Inkjet
+ Thermal

#### Shared printers

- IP-based
- Web-based

### Scanners

- Converts images from analog to digital
- Flatbed (stand alone) or multifunction device

#### Faxes and multifunction devices

- Facsimile (fax) machines send documents using landlines
- Multifunction devices often include fax capabilities

## Audio Visual Devices

### Defining audio devices

- Digital data is converted into an audible format
- Components are used to reproduce, record, or process sound
- Examples include microphones, CD players amplifiers, mixing consoles, effects units, and speakers

### Defining visual devices

- Present images electronically on-screen
- Typically, greater than 4" diagonally
- Examples include smartphones, monitors, and laptop computers
